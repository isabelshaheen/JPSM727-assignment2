I created the qmd file in my local computer and then uploaded it to the remote repository. 

The Git functionality in Rstudio wasn't working properly so I need to troubleshoot my file setup process. 

I re-ran the code and rendered again after I had already written my responses, so some of the numbers written in the paragraphs do not match exactly the numbers in the tables because the data was updated more recently through Google Trends. But the overall trends (significant correlation or not) and magnitude (one keyword has 2x the hits of the other) remain true for all the answers.
