# JPSM727-assignment2

I have broken up the assignment into 4 qmd files: 

1. Pulling from APIs - crime & loans
2. Pulling from APIs - covid keywords
3. Google Trends - crime & loans + Illinois ACS
4. Google Trends - covid keywords + Maryland ACS

I then combined all qmd files into 1 qmd file called "Assignment 2 results"

This is the file I tried to render to PDF, but the Census API site has been down for the past 2 hrs so I am unable to render the file.
